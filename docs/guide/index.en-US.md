# wskco

This is a component library developed by React+TypeScript 🎉

As for what wskco means ❓

Wsk is an abbreviation for my name, co is component, and then my code is component haha 😀

<br />

This is actually only constructed for personal advanced learning React, which is used to record what individuals think and gain on the way to learning and development 🖊

As a component library, it is not perfect, and it is not recommended to put it into production environment here ⚠

Of course, you can also use some of the source code (or ideas) as a foundation to improve your own work 🏢

<br />

Therefore, wskco **prefers to present an implementation idea** 💡 Rather than UI design 🖼️

In terms of UI, it mainly refers to the [Ant Design Component Library](https://ant.design/index-cn )


If it can help you and learn anything, I will be very happy 😁

Welcome to join or provide comments. This project will be updated for a long time. Your star ⭐， Is the greatest encouragement to me 🚀
